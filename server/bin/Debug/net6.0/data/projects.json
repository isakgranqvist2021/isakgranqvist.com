        "description": "This project was initially given to me as a single html file with the purpose of re-building the navigation system but I ended up rebuilding the whole webpage. I chose Angular 11 as my primary framework because I was extremely comfortable with Angular and still is. The source code can be provided if you would be interested in that. In retrospect I would have chosen React rather than Angular due to project size. React seems more suitable for building smaller projects in my opinion. I had about 10 re-orders from the person I was working with on this which tells me I did something correctly.",

        "description": "I started this project to manage blog posts on my main site and after a while it became more about perfecting the application rather than solving an issue I had. I later realized that an administration interface is slightly overkill for the page I had built. I went with the material design patterns as my primary direction for styling the application. I built a major part of the app in Go and learnt a lot of valuable lessons. One being from trying to mutate pointers and getting bad values in the json on the client which is unheard of when working in a language like JavaScript. The application supports spawning child processes for managing multiple applications on the same server. Go has grown to become one of my go-to languages when building a new application because if itâ€™s performance and ease of writing code.",
