		"body": "I am a 23 year old technology enthusiast and  “mostly” self-taught software developer. I have always been interested in computers and technology. I have mostly been interested in video games throughout my childhood like most young guys are. I was especially into the competitive aspect of video games. I mostly played titles like World Of Warcraft and League Of Legends. I am still interested in video games but more ones that challenge my brain like chess."

		"title": "Development Journey",
		"body": "At the age of eighteen I began watching youtube videos and searching online for programming related content and ended up learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, it was love at first sight, I instantly became obsessed with learning new programming stuff. I have tried plenty of programming languages through the years. I would consider myself a JavaScript developer but I have moderate expertise in the following languages. These are my current languages from best to worst: [ JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, Python, C# ]. I have since built countless crud applications, numerous command line tools, and a couple of games. Most of my web applications have been built with the MEAN-stack. Like this application your currently browsing is built with React and C#. Currently I am really into building React applications because it’s so lightweight and allows for the programmer to decide the program structure which of course might be a double edged sword. Angular allows for truly object oriented programming and I would say that’s the place where I really began understanding the principles of object oriented programming."

		"body": "My number one goal for the foreseeable future is to become a hireable software developer where I can devote my drive to and hopefully produce excellent software together with fun and inspiring colleagues. Outside of work/study life I have very minimal goals like improving at chess and of course being happy. Being in a company where excellent software is being produced and where learning is happening on a daily basis would be a dream come true."
