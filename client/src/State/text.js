    This project was initially given to me as a single html file with the purpose of re-building the navigation system but I ended up rebuilding the whole webpage. 
    I chose Angular 11 as my primary framework because I was extremely comfortable with Angular and still is. 
    The source code can be provided if you would be interested in that. In retrospect I would have chosen React rather than Angular due to project size. 
    React seems more suitable for building smaller projects in my opinion. 
    I had about 10 re-orders from the person I was working with on this which tells me I did something correctly.`,

    admin_dashboard: `
    I started this project to manage blog posts on my main site and after a while it became more about perfecting the application rather than solving an issue I had. 
    I later realized that an administration interface is slightly overkill for the page I had built. 
    I went with the material design patterns as my primary direction for styling the application. 
    I built a major part of the app in Go and learnt a lot of valuable lessons. 
    One being from trying to mutate pointers and getting bad values in the json on the client which is unheard of when working in a language like JavaScript. 
    The application supports spawning child processes for managing multiple applications on the same server. 
    Go has grown to become one of my go-to languages when building a new application because if it’s performance and ease of writing code.`,

    restaurant_app: `
    This project was presented to me as - build a restaurant app like uber-eats. 
    This was a school project and I used two different API's in the development process. 
    Documenu for fetching restaurant data and MapboxGL for the map integration. 
    If given the same project today there are a lot of things I would have done differently. 
    There was a restriction on the project as well which was to not use a JavaScript framework. 
    Which obviously made the process a lot more challenging.`,

    calendar_app: `
    The project was presented as a specification list and I have developed most of the things with moderate success. 
    The restrictions were not to use a SPA framework which of course made things a lot more challenging. 
    The backend was built in Node.js + Express and the client in pure JavaScript. 
    The project also makes use of sessions to enable the sign-in and sign-up features which was a requirement.`,

    who_am_i: `
    I am a 23 year old technology enthusiast and  “mostly” self-taught software developer. 
    I have always been interested in computers and technology. 
    I have mostly been interested in video games throughout my childhood like most young guys are. 
    I was especially into the competitive aspect of video games. 
    I mostly played titles like World Of Warcraft and League Of Legends. 
    I am still interested in video games but more ones that challenge my brain like chess.`,

    development_journey: `
    At the age of eighteen I began watching youtube videos and searching online for programming related content and ended up learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
    it was love at first sight, I instantly became obsessed with learning new programming stuff. 
    I have tried plenty of programming languages through the years. 
    I would consider myself a JavaScript developer but I have moderate expertise in the following languages. 
    These are my current languages from best to worst: [ JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, Python, C# ]. 
    I have since built countless crud applications, numerous command line tools, and a couple of games. 
    Most of my web applications have been built with the MEAN-stack. 
    Like this application your currently browsing is built with React and C#. 
    Currently I am really into building React applications because it’s so lightweight and allows for the programmer to decide the program structure which of course might be a double edged sword. 
    Angular allows for truly object oriented programming and I would say that’s the place where I really began understanding the principles of object oriented programming.`,

    goals: `
    My number one goal for the foreseeable future is to become a hireable software developer where I can devote my drive to and hopefully produce excellent software together with fun and inspiring colleagues. 
    Outside of work/study life I have very minimal goals like improving at chess and of course being happy. 
    Being in a company where excellent software is being produced and where learning is happening on a daily basis would be a dream come true.`
